# UML
The unified Modeling Language.
 
## Purpose
Allow us to model an application before writing any code. Think of it as a cliff notes for the application. Use it to model complex applications, labeling their properties and methods.

## Tip
When modeled well, an application under TDD is a hundreds times simpler.

## Requirements
I will not be requiring UML in class but it is highly suggested you use it. I will use it to help design in class topics and when you encounter issues resulting from complexities, I will ask you for yours.
