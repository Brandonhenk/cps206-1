JALC CPS206 Course Notes, Code Examples, [Homeworks](homeworks/), and [Labs](labs/)

## Tenative Schedule
We will reveiw CPS176 in full. Then we will cover the following are the core topics to OOP while learning standard enterprise patterns of behavior. Finally, if time permits, we will cover advanced java topics applying the skills you have learned throughtout the semester.

### Review of [CPS176](https://github.com/anthonykulis/cps176) (1 to 3 weeks)
* Reviews basic language constructs from data types to arrays.

### Introduction to Versioning
* Introduces [Git and Github](git/) for code versioning using commit, pull, push.

### Advanced Java Construct Concepts (1 to 3 weeks)
* [Exceptions](advanced_java_concepts/exceptions.md), [Recursion](advanced_java_concepts/recursion), [Iterators](advanced_java_concepts/iterators), leveraging existing [java 8 API](advanced_java_concepts/java8api.md), using [generic classes](advanced_java_concepts/generic_classes).
* Introduces [UML](advanced_java_concepts/uml.md) for the purpose of *swarming* a programming problem/feature.
* Introcution to unit testing with [JUnit](advanced_java_concepts/junit.md) (pending software approval from school).

### [Basic Classes](classes/basic) (1 week)
* Covers keywords, basic theory, construction, and using.

### [Basic Inheritance](oop_pillars/inheritance/basic) (2 to 3 weeks)
* How to extend objects enforcing the DRY principle leveraging proper abstractions

### Introduction to [Polymorphism](oop_pillars/polymorphism) (1 week)
* What is polymorphism and when and why to use it.

### [Advanced Inheritance](oop_pillars/inheritance/advanced) (2 to 3 weeks)
* Leveraging Object inheritance for the purpose of polymorphism

### [Basic Interfaces](interfaces/basic) (1 week)
* How to create and when to use interfaces.

### [Advanced Interfaces](interfaces/advanced) (2 to 3 weeks)
